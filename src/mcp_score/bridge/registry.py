"""Which application the server is talking to right now.

The server keeps one bridge per supported application and at most one of
them active. Connecting to an application deactivates the previous one,
so a tool never has to ask which application it is operating on. The
server owns the registry for its lifetime and hands it to the tools
through their context.
