"""Manipulation tools: change the score in the connected application.

Every tool that takes a measure moves there first and refuses to continue
if the application cannot get there, so a change never lands in the wrong
place. What an application cannot do comes back as its own explanation:
the Remote Control API of Dorico and Sibelius triggers commands but cannot
type into popovers or move the selection, so most of these tools work with
MuseScore only.
