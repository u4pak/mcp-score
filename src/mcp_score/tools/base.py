"""What every tool module shares.

A tool raises the MCP SDK's :class:`ToolError` when it cannot proceed,
and the server reports it to the model as a tool error. An application's
refusal reaches a tool as a :class:`BridgeError`; :func:`score_tool`
reports it the same way, so no tool handles errors itself. Tools that
talk to an application take the server's :class:`ScoreContext` first,
which the MCP SDK injects; the ``require_*`` guards check the common
preconditions and :func:`navigate` moves the application's cursor before
an edit.
