# mcp-score

Music notation for AI assistants. Describe a piece in plain language and get a MusicXML score; with MuseScore open, read and edit the live score by conversation.

Works with any MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, LM Studio, and others). Status: alpha.

## Quick demo

> "Create a big band chart: 32-bar AABA form, key of Bb, slow blues at 66 BPM, with rhythm changes and rehearsal marks at each section."

The assistant writes a complete music21 script, runs it, and hands you a MusicXML file ready to open in MuseScore, Dorico, or any notation app.

With the MuseScore plugin running, you can go further:

> "Read the melody in bars 9-16 and arrange it as a trombone soli following the chord progression."

The assistant reads the live score, applies musical judgement, and writes the arrangement back, all through conversation.

## What it does

- **Generate scores.** The assistant writes a [music21](https://www.music21.org/) script that exports MusicXML, which opens in MuseScore, Dorico, or any notation app. In Claude Code this is driven by the bundled `score-generate` skill. In other MCP clients, the `generate_score` tool runs the script and `score_generation_guide` supplies the same instructions.
- **Edit live scores.** MCP tools connect to a running MuseScore and read passages, add notes, dynamics and chord symbols, set barlines, keys, time signatures and tempo, append measures, transpose, and undo.
- **Render.** The `render_score` tool exports PDF, PNG, MIDI, audio or MusicXML from a score file through the MuseScore command line; MuseScore must be installed but not running.

## Supported applications

| Application      | Versions                  | Status                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MuseScore Studio | 4.4.2 and later           | Supported; CI tests the oldest supported line, a middle release and the newest. Earlier versions lack the plugin WebSocket API. |
| Dorico           | 4 and later               | Experimental. Undocumented Remote Control API, command-only, not verified against a running instance.                           |
| Sibelius         | Ultimate 2024.3 and later | Experimental. Sibelius Connect, command-only, not verified against a running instance.                                          |
| Any notation app | MusicXML import           | Generated scores open anywhere MusicXML does.                                                                                   |

## Install

Requires Python 3.14 or later.

```bash
pip install mcp-score-server
# or
uv tool install mcp-score-server
```

Then:

```bash
mcp-score install-plugin   # MuseScore plugin, for live editing
mcp-score install-skill    # score-generate skill, for Claude Code
```

## Connect your MCP client

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add mcp-score -- mcp-score serve
```

Claude Desktop and other clients: run the command `mcp-score` with the argument `serve`, for example in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-score": { "command": "mcp-score", "args": ["serve"] }
  }
}
```

## Use it with MuseScore

1. Open a score in MuseScore Studio 4.4.2 or later.
2. Plugins > Manage plugins > enable **MCP Score Bridge**, then Plugins > MCP Score Bridge. Keep its window open.
3. Ask your assistant to connect to MuseScore.

Details and troubleshooting: [MuseScore plugin](docs/musescore-plugin.md).
