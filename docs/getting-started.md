# Getting started

> Tutorial -- set up mcp-score and generate your first score.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.14+
- An MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc.)
- [MuseScore Studio 4.4.2+](https://musescore.org/en/download) (optional -- needed for live manipulation features)

## Installation

```bash
pip install mcp-score-server
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv tool install mcp-score-server
```

### Install the score generation skill

```bash
mcp-score install-skill
```

This copies the `score-generate` skill to `~/.claude/skills/score-generate/`.

### Install the MuseScore plugin (optional)

```bash
mcp-score install-plugin
```

This copies the WebSocket bridge plugin to `~/Documents/MuseScore4/Plugins/`. Restart MuseScore, then enable it: Plugins > Manage plugins > MCP Score Bridge. Running the plugin opens a status window; keep it open while you work.

## Configure your MCP client

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add mcp-score -- mcp-score serve
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-score": {
      "command": "mcp-score",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Generate your first score

With the `score-generate` skill installed, just ask Claude:

> "Create a 12-bar blues lead sheet in Bb major at 120 BPM."

Claude writes a music21 Python script, runs it, and produces a `.musicxml` file on your Desktop. Open it in MuseScore.

More examples:

> "Write a big band chart -- 32-bar AABA form, Bb major, slow blues at 66 BPM. Standard big band instrumentation: 5 saxes, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, piano, guitar, bass, drums."

> "Create a string quartet in D major, 3/4 time, 16 measures at 72 BPM."

### Other MCP clients

Clients other than Claude Code cannot load the skill, so the server offers the same workflow as tools. Ask the assistant to read `score_generation_guide` (or load the `score-generate` prompt, if the client supports prompts) and then call `generate_score` with its music21 script. The tool runs the script and returns the paths of the files it wrote.

## Live MuseScore manipulation

For reading and modifying a score that's already open in MuseScore:

1. Open a score in MuseScore Studio 4.4.2 or later
2. Start the MCP Score Bridge plugin (Plugins menu) and keep its window open
3. Ask Claude:

> "Connect to MuseScore."

> "What's in the score right now?"

> "Read measures 1 through 8 of the first staff."

> "Add a rehearsal mark 'A' at measure 1 and a double barline at measure 8."

> "Transpose the trumpet part in measures 5-8 up a perfect fourth (5 semitones)."

> "Undo that last change."

All modifications happen immediately in MuseScore.

## Live Dorico manipulation (experimental)

Dorico support is experimental: it uses Dorico's undocumented Remote Control WebSocket API, is command-only (it cannot read note content), and has not been verified against a running Dorico instance. To try it, enable Remote Control in Dorico's preferences and ask Claude to "Connect to Dorico."

## Live Sibelius manipulation (experimental)

Sibelius support is experimental: Sibelius Connect speaks the same command-only Remote Control protocol as Dorico (it cannot read note content), and it has not been verified against a running Sibelius instance. It requires Sibelius Ultimate 2024.3 or later. To try it, enable Sibelius Connect in Sibelius's preferences and ask Claude to "Connect to Sibelius."
