# Architecture

> Explanation -- how mcp-score is structured and why.

## Overview

mcp-score does three things for an AI assistant:

1. **Score generation** -- the assistant writes a music21 Python script that exports MusicXML, openable in any notation software. In Claude Code the bundled `score-generate` skill drives this. In any other MCP client the `generate_score` tool runs the script and `score_generation_guide` (also served as the `score-generate` MCP prompt) supplies the same instructions
2. **Live manipulation** via MCP server -- read from and write to a running score application (MuseScore Studio 4.4.2+, or experimentally Dorico or Sibelius) through a WebSocket bridge
3. **Rendering** -- the `render_score` tool exports PDF, PNG, MIDI, audio or MusicXML from a score file through the MuseScore command line; MuseScore must be installed but not running

```

The server registers the tool modules: connection, analysis, manipulation, generation and rendering. Generation and rendering work on files and need no live connection.

## Multi-bridge design

mcp-score supports multiple score notation applications through a common bridge abstraction. Only one bridge is active at a time -- connecting to a new application automatically disconnects the previous one.

### Bridge abstraction

`ScoreBridge` (in `bridge/base.py`) defines the common interface that all MCP tools depend on. The bridge hierarchy:

```
ScoreBridge (ABC)             -- the operations every tool needs
└── WebSocketBridge           -- connection lifecycle over a WebSocketTransport, one reconnect
    ├── MuseScoreBridge       -- the MuseScore QML plugin's command/params protocol
    ├── SibeliusBridge        -- Sibelius Connect: command IDs and the ManuScript plug-in
    └── RemoteControlBridge   -- Remote Control handshake/command protocol
        └── DoricoBridge      -- Dorico defaults (port 4560)
```

- `ScoreBridge` -- the abstract interface: connection, navigation, reading, and every edit the tools offer, each returning one of the result models in `bridge/results.py` and raising `BridgeError` when the application cannot do it
- `WebSocketTransport` -- owns the socket: open, close, send, and one request/reply exchange
- `WebSocketBridge` -- connects a transport, auto-connects on the first command, reconnects once on a lost connection, and gives subclasses two hooks (`_on_connected`, `_on_disconnecting`) for their protocol's handshake
- `MuseScoreBridge` -- frames commands for the MuseScore plugin and maps the interface to plugin commands
- `RemoteControlBridge` -- Remote Control protocol logic, kept separate from application defaults: handshake with session tokens, command formatting, barline mapping, and limitation messages
- `DoricoBridge` -- thin subclass providing Dorico-specific defaults
- `SibeliusBridge` -- Sibelius Connect's handshake and messages, with the cursor tracked on the Python side

### Bridge registry

`bridge/registry.py` holds one bridge per application and tracks the active one. `BridgeRegistry.activate(bridge)` disconnects whichever bridge was active, then connects the new one, so a failed connection leaves nothing active; `deactivate(bridge)` disconnects it; `connected()` returns the active bridge only while it is connected. There is no module-level registry: `server.py` creates one per server and hands it to the tools as `AppState` through the SDK's context injection (`context.py`). `require_bridge(context)` in `tools/base.py` reads the connected bridge from it and raises `ToolError` when nothing is connected.

### Remote Control protocol (Dorico)

Dorico 4+ implements a "Remote Control" WebSocket protocol. The protocol logic lives in `bridge/remote_control.py`, separate from Dorico's defaults in `bridge/dorico.py`.

Dorico support is experimental: it uses Dorico's undocumented Remote Control WebSocket API, is command-only (it cannot read note content), and has not been verified against a running Dorico instance.

**Handshake protocol:**

1. Client opens WebSocket to the application's port (Dorico: 4560)
2. Client sends connect message with `clientName` and `handshakeVersion`
3. Application shows a dialog asking the user to approve the connection
4. Application responds with a session token
5. Client sends `acceptsessiontoken` with the received token
6. Application responds with `{"code": "kConnected"}`

Session tokens can be cached and reused for reconnection (the application skips the approval dialog when a valid cached token is provided).

**Dorico-specific notes:**

- Default port 4560, configurable in Dorico preferences
- No plugin needed -- Dorico IS the server

### Sibelius Connect (Sibelius)

Sibelius 2024.3+ serves Sibelius Connect, a WebSocket API on port 1898 enabled on the Input Devices page of Sibelius's preferences. Its protocol is documented in the [ManuScript Language Guide](https://resources.avid.com/SupportFiles/Sibelius/2026.6/ManuScript_Language_Guide.pdf) (chapter 6) and differs from Dorico's despite a similar `connect` message:

1. Client sends `connect` with `clientName`, `handshakeVersion` and the `plugins` it will call
2. Sibelius asks the user to allow the connection and answers `{"sessionToken": ...}`
3. The token, sent with a later `connect` instead of the plug-in list, skips the question while Sibelius keeps running

After the handshake there are two messages. `invokeCommands` runs Sibelius command IDs (the menu commands listed in chapter 5 of the guide) on the current selection; they take no parameters. `invokePlugin` calls a method of a ManuScript plug-in with arguments and returns its result as JSON.

Command IDs alone cannot reach a measure (`goto_bar` only opens a dialog), so `SibeliusBridge` uses commands where one does the job (`undo`, the `barline_*` commands) and the bundled `McpScoreBridge` plug-in (`sibelius/plugin/McpScoreBridge.plg`, installed with `mcp-score install-sibelius-plugin`) for everything that needs a position or a value: selecting bars and ranges, reading the score and the note at the cursor, notes, rehearsal marks, chord symbols, dynamics, key and time signatures, tempo, appending bars, transposing, articulations, noteheads, lines (slurs, hairpins, trills, octave lines, pedal, glissandi), staff text, clefs, rests, tuplets, tremolos and buzz rolls, grace notes (flams, drags, ruffs), sticking, and moving the cursor to any point in a measure (a beat, or a partial of one such as the "and" of 2 or the last note of a triplet). The operations from articulations on are `ScoreBridge` methods that refuse by default, so the MuseScore and Dorico bridges report them as not supported yet. ManuScript has no call that adds a rest, so the plug-in adds a note and deletes it, which leaves a rest of the same length; and since it may not add to a bar while iterating over it, it collects the notes for sticking before writing the letters. The plug-in keeps no state and never opens a dialog; the bridge tracks the cursor (measure, staff, position in the bar) and passes it to every call.

Sibelius support is experimental: the bridge and plug-in follow the ManuScript Language Guide but have not been run against a real Sibelius.

## Capabilities and limitations

Dorico's Remote Control WebSocket API is fundamentally a **command execution and UI state observation** layer. It can trigger any action the application can perform (equivalent to pressing menu items or key commands) and read the UI state. But it cannot read musical content or perform operations that require text input through popovers.

### What Dorico's API cannot do

These are constraints of Dorico's Remote Control API, not of mcp-score:

- **Chord symbols, key signatures, time signatures, tempo marks, notes, dynamics** are entered through popovers, which the API cannot type into.
- **Score content** is not readable; the API reports UI state and selection properties.
- **Staff navigation and range selection** do not exist; the API acts on the current selection.
- **MusicXML export** is not exposed by either application's WebSocket API; `render_score` covers files on disk.

## Why a skill and tools for generation, MCP for manipulation?

**Generation is best done as one script.** The assistant writes a complete music21 script in one shot, with full access to the entire music21 API. This is faster (one script vs dozens of MCP tool calls) and more flexible (no API surface to limit). Instructions that teach the assistant music21 patterns produce better results than a curated set of note-by-note tools.

In Claude Code the `score-generate` skill does exactly that, with no MCP server involved. Other MCP clients cannot load skills, so the server offers the same workflow as tools: `score_generation_guide` returns the skill files (instructions, instrument reference, template) and `generate_score` runs the script the assistant writes. The tools read the skill files from the package, so there is one source of truth for the instructions.

**Manipulation is best as MCP.** Reading from and writing to a live score application requires a persistent WebSocket connection and state management. MCP provides the right abstraction for this -- tools the assistant can call to inspect and modify the live score.

## Key design decisions

### Single server, multiple bridges

One MCP server supports multiple score applications through the bridge abstraction. Only one bridge is active at a time -- this avoids confusion about which application a tool operates on. Connecting to a new application automatically disconnects the previous one.

### MusicXML as interchange format

MusicXML is the standard interchange format, supported by MuseScore, Dorico, Sibelius and most other notation software. We do NOT generate `.mscz`/`.mscx` -- undocumented and version-fragile.

### music21 for score generation

music21 (MIT, Python) handles transposing instruments, voice leading, and MusicXML export. Used by the score-generate skill and, through `generate_score`, by every other MCP client.

### WebSocket bridges for live manipulation

Every supported application uses WebSocket for communication, but the protocols differ:

- **MuseScore**: QML plugin runs inside MuseScore Studio 4.4.2+ and opens a WebSocket server on port 8765 with MuseScore's built-in `api.websocketserver` (4.4 dropped the `QtWebSockets` QML module; 4.4.2 added the replacement, so older versions are not supported). JSON messages with `command` and `params` fields. Custom protocol -- implemented directly in `MuseScoreBridge`.
- **Dorico** (experimental): Uses Dorico's "Remote Control" protocol with `message`/`commandName` fields and session token handshake. Protocol logic lives in `RemoteControlBridge`; the thin `DoricoBridge` subclass provides Dorico's defaults (port, name).

- **Sibelius** (experimental): Sibelius Connect (Sibelius 2024.3+) runs command IDs and calls the bundled ManuScript plug-in. `SibeliusBridge` implements the handshake and both messages directly on `WebSocketBridge`, since the protocol is not Dorico's.

LilyPond is out of scope for now.

### Verified against real MuseScore in CI

The unit tests mock the WebSocket and the subprocess, so they cannot catch MuseScore API changes (4.7 renamed the undo action, for example). The `Integration` workflow therefore installs real MuseScore Studio releases -- on Linux the versions in `tests/integration/musescore-versions.json` (the oldest supported line, one in between and the newest), on Windows and macOS the newest -- and runs `tests/integration/` against them: headless `render_score` export and the live plugin bridge. `scripts/musescore_harness.py` downloads MuseScore, seeds its configuration with the plugin bound to a keyboard shortcut (plugins cannot be started from the command line), launches it with a fixture score and presses the shortcut. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#integration-tests) for running it locally.

### Server does not call LLMs

The MCP server provides primitives. The assistant is the musical intelligence.
