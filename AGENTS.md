# mcp-score

AI-driven music score generation and manipulation, for any MCP client. Three jobs:

- **Score generation** — the assistant writes a music21 Python script that exports MusicXML. In Claude Code the bundled `score-generate` skill (`.claude/skills/score-generate/`) drives this without MCP. In other clients the `generate_score` tool runs the script and `score_generation_guide` (also the `score-generate` MCP prompt) serves the same instructions.
- **Live score manipulation** via MCP server — reads from and writes to a running MuseScore Studio 4.4.2+ (or experimentally Dorico or Sibelius) via WebSocket bridge.
- **Rendering** — `render_score` exports PDF, PNG, MIDI, audio or MusicXML through the MuseScore command line.

    remote_control.py Remote Control protocol layer (used by Dorico)
    musescore.py      MuseScore plugin protocol on WebSocketBridge
    dorico.py         Dorico defaults (thin subclass of RemoteControlBridge, experimental)
    sibelius.py       Sibelius Connect protocol and plug-in calls on WebSocketBridge (experimental)
    registry.py       BridgeRegistry: the bridges and which one is active
  musescore/
    paths.py          Where MuseScore keeps user files (plugins directory)
    executable.py     Where MuseScore's executable is (env var, PATH, platform defaults)
    headless.py       Headless rendering through the MuseScore command line
    plugin/           MuseScore plugin: mcp-score-bridge.qml (server, dispatch) and its JS modules
  sibelius/
    paths.py          Where Sibelius keeps user plug-ins
    plugin/           McpScoreBridge.plg: ManuScript plug-in called through Sibelius Connect

### Why a skill and tools for generation?

One music21 script per score beats dozens of tool calls. Claude Code runs the skill directly; `generate_score` and `score_generation_guide` give every other MCP client the same script from the same skill text. Live manipulation needs a persistent connection and state, which is what MCP tools are for. Details: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Dev environment

Devbox + uv. Devbox provides Python 3.14, uv, ruff, pyright via Nix. uv manages Python packages in `.venv/`.

```bash
direnv allow         # or: devbox shell
```

## Commands

```bash
devbox run test      # run tests
devbox run lint      # lint
devbox run format    # format
devbox run typecheck # type check (strict mode)
devbox run check     # all of the above
mcp-score            # run the MCP server (after uv sync)
```

Or directly (inside devbox shell / after direnv allow):

```bash
pytest               # run tests
ruff check .         # lint
ruff format .        # format
pyright src/         # type check (strict mode)
```

Integration tests against a real MuseScore are opt-in; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#integration-tests).

**Multi-line commits:** `devbox run -- git commit -m "$(cat ...)"` produces literal `\n`. Always use `git commit -F /tmp/msg.txt` for multi-line commit messages.

## Repo-specific conventions

- **Conventional commits** — enforced by `.githooks/commit-msg`
- **Thin subclasses over monolithic duplicated implementations** — protocol logic lives in `RemoteControlBridge`; app-specific bridges (Dorico) only override defaults
- **Test non-triviality** — no issubclass checks, json.dumps wrappers, or constant assertions. Every test must cover a meaningful code path
- **Test deduplication** — shared protocol logic is tested once in the base class test file, not repeated per subclass. Per-subclass tests cover only subclass-specific behavior (defaults, overrides)
- **No counts in docs that drift** — no tool, command or test counts in documentation. List things by name or describe them; numbers go stale silently

## Tool design principles

MCP tools fall into these categories:

1. **Connection** — manage WebSocket bridges to MuseScore, Dorico and Sibelius
2. **Analysis** — read and understand musical content from the live score
3. **Manipulation** — modify the live score (notes, rehearsal marks, dynamics, chords, barlines, keys, time signatures, tempo, measures, transpose, undo; articulations, noteheads, lines, staff text, clefs, rests, tuplets, tremolos, grace notes, sticking and beat placement, which only the Sibelius bridge implements so far)
4. **Generation** — run a music21 script (`generate_score`) and serve the skill text (`score_generation_guide`) so clients other than Claude Code get the same workflow
5. **Rendering** — export a score file through the MuseScore command line (`render_score`); needs MuseScore installed, not running

In Claude Code, generation is handled by the `score-generate` skill — Claude writes music21 scripts directly, giving full API access without an MCP bottleneck.

## Key technical decisions

The rationale lives in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#key-design-decisions) and the decision ledger in [issue #91](https://github.com/tskovlund/mcp-score/issues/91). The constraints to keep in mind while coding:

- **MuseScore Studio 4.4.2+ only** for the live plugin; older versions lack the plugin WebSocket API. Dorico and Sibelius are experimental. Sibelius goes through Sibelius Connect and the bundled ManuScript plug-in, which keeps no state and must never open a dialog.
- **MusicXML** is the interchange format; never generate `.mscz`/`.mscx`.
- **PyPI name `mcp-score-server`**; the import package `mcp_score` and the CLI `mcp-score` keep their names.
- **Integration tests run against real MuseScore** in CI on all three platforms; the versions live in `tests/integration/musescore-versions.json`.

## Git workflow

### PR workflow

1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes, test with `pytest` and manual MuseScore testing
3. Push and create PR
4. Review loop: wait for CI -> address review comments -> push -> iterate until clean
5. Squash merge

One small PR per change. Much of the code is written with Claude Code; the maintainer reviews every PR before merge. Versioning is semver, 0.x until stable.

### Issue tracking

GitHub Issues for implementation tracking. Linear for higher-level planning (workspace: tskovlund, project: MCP Music Notation). The decision ledger for the beta is [issue #91](https://github.com/tskovlund/mcp-score/issues/91); check it before re-opening a settled question.
